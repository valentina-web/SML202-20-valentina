Received pronunciation is the great communicator
00:03
as soon as you deviate from that and you go into London speech for example then
00:07
you lose a little bit of the communication.
00:09
cockney is based on East Anglian
00:12
Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, this is often by
00:16
actors confused with the West Country where the R's come in and then you get
00:20
Dorset and Somerset get into Cornwall. Devon's slightly different it goes into
00:25
the nose bit more like that
00:27
then you go up north to Yorkshire it's nice if you get
00:30
a word that's got one on the predominant sounds in it like yark
00:33
sheer then you cross the Pennines into Lancashire where he gets much more flexible and
00:38
fluid in the mouth
00:39
Liverpool is there too, you know, it's Scouse
00:42
it's a mixture of all kinds of sounds one of those
00:46
is Northern Irish with the rising inflections
00:49
but you don't get the rising inflections down in Dublin where
00:52
it has that poetic quality which is sometimes
00:56
thought of as being not different from Highland speech which is
01:00
also quite poetic and almost Scandinavian
01:04
and then you come down to Glasgow and into the Lowlands of Scotland where you
01:09
get glottal stops and things like that. Then you come down
01:12
the west coast and you're in Wales, North Wales
01:15
where it's breathy like that and down into South Wales where you get
01:19
much heavier and Welsh people who sometimes even sound
01:23
a bit drunk.
